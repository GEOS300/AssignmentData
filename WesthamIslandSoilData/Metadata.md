# Metadata for Westham Island Station Data

TIME(PST): Date and Time (YYYY-mm-DD HHMM) in Pacific Standard Time, corresponding to the end of a fifteen-minute observation interval.  All data values are averaged over the interval.

T_1: Soil temperature at 5 cm depth in deg C

T_2: Soil temperature at 10 cm depth in deg C

T_3: Soil temperature at 20 cm depth in deg C

T_4: Soil temperature at 50 cm depth in deg C

H_g : Soil heat flux density at 7.5 cm depth in W m^-2

VWC: Soil volumetric water content at 7.5 cm depth in m^3 m^-3

R_n : Net all-wave radiation at 2 m height in W m^-2

H : Turbulent sensible heat flux density at 2 m height in W m^-2 (**average every 30 min**)
